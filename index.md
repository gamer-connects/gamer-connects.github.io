# Overview

Gamer Connect is a web application that helps UH students discover and connect with other gamers on campus based on their favorite games, skill levels, gaming goals (casual play, ranked competition, streaming, etc.), and availability. By creating detailed gamer profiles, students can find like-minded players to form teams, join communities, or just find new friends to play with.

## What makes UH Connect special:

- **Campus-Focused:** Exclusively for UH students, creating a trusted gaming community
- **Interest Matching:** Advanced filtering by game preferences, play styles, and skill levels
- **Event Discovery:** Centralized hub for gaming tournaments, LAN parties, and esports events on campus
- **Personalized Recommendations:** AI-driven game and player suggestions based on user profiles
- **Team Building:** Easy formation of competitive teams and casual gaming groups

Unlike general gaming platforms like Discord or Reddit, UH Connect provides a curated, campus-specific environment where students can safely connect with verified UH peers who share their gaming interests.
